## [Unrelease-Maybe]

- allow toggle of validation to increase load speed
- add minimum tokens to match to graphparser edge constrains

## [Unreleased-TODO]

#### Added

- added graphparser._types.py module with ParserRule, ParserOutput,
  OnMatchRule, WhiteSpace, and DirectedGraph classes
- added tests/test_graphparser.py
- added graphparser init and constructors: from_yaml_file, from_yaml,
  from_dict. They are cascaded: from_yaml_file calls from_yaml, which calls
  from_dict. Added a "raw" parameter, to from_dict as to whether or the dict
  needs to be processed from easy-reading format (default is True)
- added _unescape_charnames to graphparser module to unescape \\N{CHARNAME}
  strings (from files, especially)
- added graphparser/validate.py to handle validation of raw and
  processed settings, using `Cerberus`

  whitespace tointernal types Rules, OnMatchRules, and Whitespace;
  and, to generate the parser's internal DirectedGraph
